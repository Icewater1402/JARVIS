# JARVIS
JARVIS from Iron Man but nerfed, functioning only as a secretary to manage my schedule

## 11/13/2024
* HE LIVES 
* Voice recognition works 
* FIXME: text_responder needs work. Lots of issues with API versions and functions 
* Reached limit on quota - whatever that means 

## 11/18/2024
* JARVIS now runs on DialoGPT because OpenAI is too expensive and NOT free
* JARVIS can now receive chat inputs 
* FIXME timeout for how much text model can receive 
* Need to see if we're better off making custom responses instead of making JARVIS chat for now
